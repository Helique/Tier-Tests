RUN THE PROGRAM!

Look at the MainExecutable.
1. What are the names of the two variables declared in the main function?
2. What do you think they each do?

Look at the Logic_Hertz and Render_Hertz under the GamePanel class.
1. Change the Logic_Hertz number up and down, what happened?
2. Change the Render_Hertz number up and down, what happened?
3. Can the Render_Hertz be lower than Logic_Hertz?
Return the values to 30 and 60 after your done.

Look at the Monstor class, specifically the constructor 
*public Monster(double[][] setPathPoints, double setSpeed)*
1. notice the setSpeed

Look at the GamePanel class, specifically the line that adds a monster 
*monsterList.add(new Monster(Level1,5));* ~ line #60
1. change the number 5 to something else, what happended?
2. Can you set it to a decimal number? why?

Go to the Monster.java class and find this line in the constructor.
*Speed = setSpeed;*
1. replace it with the line *Speed = Math.abs(setSpeed);*
2. what problem did we just solve?

Final Problem:
1. Create a new level.
2. Prompt the user with a pop-up and ask them which
